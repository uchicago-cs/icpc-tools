EWTeam + PC^2 stress tester
=========================

No proper documentation yet. In a nutshell, if you want to use this stress tester,
you should do the following:

1. Make sure Locust is installed (http://locust.io/)

2. Rename config.yaml.sample to config.yaml. Tweak configuration values as needed.

3. Create a contest in PC^2 that matches the values in config.yaml. You can use
   the provided contest.yaml to create the necessary accounts and languages.

4. Add a couple of problems (make sure config.yaml has the correct problem names)
   The provided problem takes a text file as input and writes the number of lines
   as output. The "gen_files.py" script can generate input/output files for this problem.

5. Run "locust" from the same directory that contains "locustfile.py".

6. Go to "http://localhost:8089/" and specify the number of users to generate. The number
   of users should not exceed the number of team accounts created in PC^2.

7. [Optional] Set up PC^2 to do autojudging, and run a PC^2 Judge to judge the submissions
   generated by the stress tester.
